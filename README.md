# Power-amplifier
The aim of this work is to characterize a FET transistor in order design a narrowband power amplifier at a frequency of 1.8 Ghz. The procedure to be followed is: • Static characterization: choice of a polarization. • Linear characterization: study of stability and gain. • Nonlinear characterization: determination of the compression at 1 dB, power spectrum.
